          <p>
            This is a photo gallery i made where the user can search a specific
            photo by its caption and there is also a lightbox for navigating
            between photos.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript was used for making the lightbox and search function
            along with some CSS for styling.

          <p>
            In this project i made a "WHEEL OF SUCESS" game where a player needs
            to guess the correct words in a phrase using the on-screen keyboard
            with a maximum of 5 wrong letters. If the player succeeds, a winner
            finish screen will congratulate him, else a lose screen will appear.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of CSS and JavaScript was involved in making this game come to
            life.

            This is an interactive dashboard for viewing traffic and also
            sending messages to certain users. There is a search function for
            searching users and also local storage enabled for storing settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was made with HTML/SCSS and JavaScript and is both
            mobile and desktop friendly. Inline SVG's where also used on this
            dashboard.

          <p>
            This employee directory uses an public API for populating the user
            cards with 12 random users. The cards also have a modal which
            displays even more user data on click. There are also buttons for
            navigating forwards and backwards between users along with a search
            function for filtering user names.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here i used some CSS and a lot of JavaScript for displaying the
            modal, getting the users and also for the search function.
